# 🎯 Quick Start Without R2 Upload

For immediate testing, I'll set up the system to work with local fallbacks while you prepare the R2 upload.

## ✅ What's Ready Now

The token logo system is fully implemented and will work with:

1. **Local Development**: Uses local token list file
2. **Fallback Display**: Shows symbol badges when images aren't available
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Will automatically use R2 logos once uploaded

## 🚀 Immediate Testing

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit the trading interface
open http://localhost:3000/trade
```

## 📋 Current Token Logo Status

| Token           | Symbol | Fallback Display | R2 Upload Status |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| BCT Chain Token | BCT    | "BC" badge       | ⏳ Pending       |
| Rajavej coin    | RAJ    | "RA" badge       | ⏳ Pending       |
| LISA COIN       | LISA   | "LI" badge       | ⏳ Pending       |
| Wrapped Ether   | WETH   | "WE" badge       | ⏳ Pending       |
| USD Gold        | USDG   | "US" badge       | ⏳ Pending       |

## 🎨 How It Looks

Without uploaded images, the system shows:

- **Professional circular badges** with token symbol initials
- **Gradient backgrounds** (blue to purple)
- **Consistent sizing** across all interfaces
- **Smooth loading states**

## 📈 Next Steps Priority

1. **Test locally first** (works immediately)
2. **Prepare token logo images** (PNG, 128x128px recommended)
3. **Upload to R2** when ready
4. **Logos automatically replace badges** once available

## 🔧 R2 Upload When Ready

Follow the `MANUAL_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` when you have:

- Token logo PNG files ready
- Cloudflare R2 access configured
- Time to upload and test

The system is designed to work perfectly in both states! 🎉
